# The Mngle
## Inspiration
In the current landscape, there is a lack of engaging interactions and meaningful connections, resulting in weak team bonding. The Mngle seeks to revolutionize this by using Gemini AI to create personalized icebreaker questions, solving the issue of uninteresting conversations in virtual meetings and social gatherings. Our commitment is to eliminate awkward silences, promote memorable interactions, and establish a new benchmark for physical socializing.

## What it does
The Mngle website enhances social interactions and increases team bonding through innovative technology. Utilizing Gemini AI, it provides personalized icebreaker questions that keep conversations engaging in events and team environments. This intelligent use of AI fosters meaningful connections and adds an element of excitement to each interaction. Say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to a captivating way of connecting where every conversation contributes to strengthening team bonds.

## How we built it
The website is built using Python and Flask for the back-end to ensure smooth operation. On the front-end, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are utilized to create the user interface and interactive elements. Additionally, the Gemini API is integrated to provide personalized and engaging content, enhancing the overall user experience on the platform.

## Challenges we ran into
In the journey of creating The Mngle project, our team faced a unique and challenging learning curve. With no prior experience, we had to swiftly grasp and implement the tools and technologies required. The challenge was compounded by our limited background in developing both the back-end and front-end of a website, coupled with the added complexity of integrating a generative AI API, namely Gemini AI. Navigating these unfamiliar challenges, our team embraced the task of prompting Gemini AI to generate the personalized icebreaker questions we desired. This dynamic process of learning, adapting, and integrating technologies in real-time not only expanded our skill set but also contributed to the overall success of The Mngle project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite our lack of prior hackathon experience, we managed to successfully complete The Mngle project within the allocated timeframe. Our limited experience in both backend and frontend website development, along with the challenge of integrating a generative AI API, made the learning curve steep. However, our collective dedication and hard work paid off as we overcame these challenges and created a functional and innovative project. This first-time experience tested our skills, demonstrated our ability to adapt, and highlighted our teamwork capabilities. It represents a significant milestone in our journey, enhancing our confidence and laying the groundwork for more ambitious projects in the future.

## What we learned
During our time at Unihack, we delved into a variety of technologies and grappled with the challenges of working together as a team to integrate them. This hands-on experience not only broadened our understanding of different technologies but also highlighted the complexities of coordination in a team setting. The lessons learned and the problem-solving skills honed during Unihack will undoubtedly serve each of us well in our future projects. The collaborative nature of the experience has equipped us with valuable insights into effective teamwork and will undoubtedly contribute to our success in upcoming endeavours.

## What's next for The Mngler
The future of The Mngle project involves adding new features and improving the user interface to enhance user experience and promote engaging interactions. Plans also include developing a native mobile app to meet the increasing demand for mobile access, with a focus on addressing security concerns. Our goal is to enhance The Mngle's capabilities while prioritizing user data security and platform integrity. This strategic roadmap reflects our dedication to ongoing improvement, meeting user needs, and providing a secure and enjoyable experience for all Mngle users.
